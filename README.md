## Loging into the web server

The easiest way to run this and other notebooks for staff and students at Monash University is to log into the Jupyter server at [https://sci-web17-v01.ocio.monash.edu.au/hub](https://sci-web17-v01.ocio.monash.edu.au/hub) The steps for running notebooks are:

* Log in using your monash email address. The first time you log in an empty account will automatically be set up for you.
* Press the start button (if prompted by the system)
* Use the menu of the jupyter system to upload a .ipynb python notebook file or to start a new notebook.


## Installing

Python runs on windows, linux, mac and other environments. 
There are many python distributions available. However the recommended way to install python under Microsoft Windows or Linux is to use the Anaconda distribution available at [https://www.continuum.io/downloads]([https://www.continuum.io/downloads). 
Make sure to get the Python 3.5 version, not 2.7. 
This distribution comes with the SciPy collection of scientific python tools as well as the iron python notebook. 
For developing python code without notebooks consider using spyder (also included with Anaconda)

To open a notebook with anaconda installed, from the terminal run:

```
ipython notebook
```
